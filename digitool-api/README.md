Files to query and extract descriptive metadata from DigiTool
-------------------------------------------------------------

*The DigiTool API is not always effective. The recommended method for retrieving 
metadata from DigiTool is the 'Export Digital Entities' job in the staff interface.
Please see the [BC wiki](https://bcwiki.bc.edu/display/UL/Export+Digital+Entities) 
for more information (staff login required).*

Files needed:
    getMetadata.pl -> Perl script to access API
    query.xml -> XML file containing search parameters
    extractMDfromCDATA.xsl -> Stylesheet to extract descriptive metadata from XML returned by API
    call.xml -> Configuration file for getMetadata.pl. This file should not be modified.
    general.xml -> Configuration file for getMetadata.pl. The value of <owner> needs to be set to whichever DigiTool Admin      unit you are searching.


Usage:
    getMetadata.pl queryfile output metadata
    
    Where
    queryfile is XML file containing DigiTool Query
    output is directory for XML output
    metadata is Metadata type to extract (mods, marc, dc, etdms)

Note for Mac and Linux users:
The file output destinations are written for Windows machines. In order to save 
the files properly in Unix-based operating systems, you will need to modify the 
$file and $objFile variables to use forward slashes instead of backslashes.
