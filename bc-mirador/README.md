## Mirador Utilities
#### generate_mirador_view.rb
Takes a IIIF manifest as input and outputs an HTML landing page that instantiates 
Mirador. As currently written, this script creates one page per manifest.

Before using, replace 'GA_TRACKING_ID' in the 'doc' variable with your Google 
Analytics tracking ID.

Usage:
1. Create one or more IIIF manifests using the [metsiiif gem](https://github.com/BCLibraries/mets-to-iiif)).

2. Run generate_mirador_view.rb on the manifest you created, e.g.:

```bash
ruby generate_mirador_view.rb BC1988_027_ref57.json > BC1988_027_ref57
```

Or use a 'for' loop if you are generating multiple Mirador pages at once:

```bash
for manifest in ./commencement-photos/manifests/*.json; do ruby generate_mirador_view.rb $manifest > `basename $manifest .json`; done
```

3. Copy the output file(s) to the Mirador server. You should now be able to view 
a manifest in Mirador using its ArchivesSpace identifier in the URI, e.g.: 
`https://library.bc.edu/iiif/view/BC1988_027_ref57`

## Mirador Stylesheets and Plugins
#### mirador-bc.css
Includes local customizations to Mirador's appearance. This stylesheet should be 
loaded in the Mirador landing page after 'mirador-combined.css'. 

#### bcViewer.js
Helper script to initialize the settings for the Mirador viewer.

#### downloadImage.js
Plugin that allows end users to download the currently displayed canvas at 
full resolution.

#### downloadCanvas.js
Not currently in use. An experimental attempt to directly download the current 
canvas using XHRs. Retained for documentation purposes as we may return to it at 
some point.

## Mirador Usage Notes
#### Linking to thumbnails, manifests, and canvases
To request a thumbnail, use the syntax provided by the [IIIF Image API](http://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/#image-request-uri-syntax). 
The parameters can be adjusted as needed. E.g., to request a 200x200 thumbnail: 
`https://scenery.bc.edu/image_id.jp2/full/!200,200/0/default.jpg`

Manifests can be rendered in Mirador using the following formula, where 
manifest_id is the handle suffix/resource ID:
`https://library.bc.edu/iiif/view/manifest_id`

Manifests can also be viewed and downloaded as JSON:
`https://library.bc.edu/iiif/manifests/manifest_id.json`

It is not currently possible to link to an individual canvas. We are considering 
using the Bavarian State Library's [ViewFromUrl plugin](https://github.com/dbmdz/mirador-plugins/tree/master/ViewFromUrl) 
to implement this functionality on a case by case basis.

#### Generating manifests
[metsiiif](https://github.com/BCLibraries/mets-to-iiif) is a Ruby gem that converts 
a METS file to a IIIF manifest. This has been tested only with METS that conforms 
to the BC application profile. We will publish it to rubygems.org once we confirm 
broader compatibility. Feeback and pull requests are welcome.
